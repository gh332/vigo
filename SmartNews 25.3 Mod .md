News provides a daily account of events happening around the world. It consists of statements that deliver new and fresh information about specific topics or incidents to readers or listeners. Unlike the past, when events in one part of the world had little impact on others, today, any occurrence in one corner of the globe can directly affect lives elsewhere. Our world has become smaller, making it essential to stay informed about global happenings.

Traditional methods of receiving news include newspapers, radio, and television. However, news reporting is no longer limited to specific sources, as numerous outlets worldwide present news from their unique perspectives. Following all these sources is impractical, and one can typically rely on only one or two.
