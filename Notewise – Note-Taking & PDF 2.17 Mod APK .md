We can prevent forgetting our ideas by quickly jotting them down on paper as soon as they come to mind. Today, note-taking has evolved, thanks to Android smartphones. Notewise – Note-Taking & PDF is a digital note-taking and whiteboard app developed by a company of the same name and available on Google Play. This app helps users ensure that their ideas and creativity are never forgotten, allowing them to save notes in text or image format whenever needed.

Like any other note-taking app, Notewise offers a variety of features. One of its main features is the ability to take notes in your own handwriting. Just like a whiteboard, but digitally, you can write down all your ideas and add various designs using brushes and colors. Several templates, such as blank pages and lined pages, are available for you to choose from.

Another useful feature is the ability to categorize notes into different folders. You can create multiple folders without any limitations. Once your notes are organized into folders, you'll see thumbnail images of your notes when you enter the folders, making it easy to select the desired note. 

The app also allows you to export your notes. Since you can write in your own handwriting and add designs, you can export your notes as images or PDF files. If your notes span multiple pages, there's no need to worry, as PDF files will also be exported as multi-page documents.
