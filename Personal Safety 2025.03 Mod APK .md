Every year, millions of traffic accidents occur worldwide. While many of these accidents result in minor financial damages, some are severe enough to cause serious injuries or even fatalities among vehicle occupants. Often, those involved in serious accidents are unable to contact emergency services or the police due to a lack of awareness, leading to critical delays in receiving help, which can result in severe injuries or death.

In recent years, various companies have introduced innovative ideas to reduce the impact of traffic accidents, and significant technologies have been developed in this area. Google, as one of the leading technology providers, has also entered this field, offering a feature on its Pixel phones that can save many lives. This feature is available as an app.

**Personal Safety** is an app designed to notify emergency services when a user is involved in a severe traffic accident. Developed by Google LLC and available for free on Google Play, this app continuously monitors the vehicle's speed. If there is a sudden decrease in speed, it listens for loud, sudden sounds, such as the sound of a crash or screams. If such a sound is detected, it triggers a loud, continuous alarm. This alarm is intended to allow the user, if conscious, to cancel the alert. If the user does not turn off the alarm by pressing a button, the app automatically sends a message with the user's location to the police and emergency services.

Users can also add close contacts, such as family and friends, to the app so that they can be notified in case of an incident. If the user is wearing a smartwatch, fitness tracker, or other wearable devices, the app can receive vital signs from these devices and send them to emergency services, enabling a quicker response in critical situations. 

In addition to accidents, the app can also send your location to the police in cases of theft or when encountering reckless bus drivers. Please note that this app is currently only functional in the United States.
